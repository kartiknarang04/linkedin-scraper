1/ You might get too much help with challenges 
‚ö†Ô∏è Could ask for advice without fear of judgment

2/ You could make real, lifelong friends 
‚ö†Ô∏è You might start caring about your coworkers üò≥

3/ Danger of creating an enviously positive culture 
‚ö†Ô∏è People might actually like Mondays

4/ Might get invited to too many after-work events 
‚ö†Ô∏è You‚Äôll be forced to have fun on weeknights

5/ You could learn new skills by accident 
‚ö†Ô∏è Just by being around smart people

6/ Risk of honest feedback from people who care 
‚ö†Ô∏è Growth could become inevitable

7/ You might enjoy meetings 
‚ö†Ô∏è Yes‚Ä¶ even team meetings

8/ Risk of expanding your comfort zone without realising 
‚ö†Ô∏è And actually grow (scary right !?)

9/ You might become a better communicator 
‚ö†Ô∏è People may start calling you a leader

10/ New ideas might show up unexpectedly 
‚ö†Ô∏è Creative ideas flow better among friends

11/ Job satisfaction might reach record highs 
‚ö†Ô∏è Risk of becoming the most engaged employee

12/ Access to informal knowledge across departments 
‚ö†Ô∏è You might start to know too much!

I get it...

Keeping work ""strictly professional"" feels safer.

No drama. 
No getting hurt. 
No tricky stuff with projects and promotions.

But research shows friendship at work is a serious performance booster.

Because people need people.

And when you like who you work with, work gets easier.

Agreed?

‚ôªÔ∏è Repost if you‚Äôve got a work friend who makes everything better.
