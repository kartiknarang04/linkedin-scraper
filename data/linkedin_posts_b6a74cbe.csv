Robertsch%C3%B6Ne,https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertsch%C3%B6ne,"👉 Back to Real Life!
Nachdem wir in den letzten Tagen gesehen haben, was die KI schon alles kann 🤖, ist es mal wieder Zeit, zurück ins echte Leben zu gehen.

Da sind die wenigsten von uns Action-Helden, sondern ganz normale analoge Menschen. Und das ist auch gut so! 🙌

Gleichzeitig können wir beide Welten kombinieren: KI und MI, Digitalisierung und Detox, Automatisierung und Achtsamkeit.

Genau das planen Steffi Kieffer und ich Ende Mai und im Oktober 📅.
Wir wollen mit Gleichgesinnten entdecken, was es bedeutet, mit KI zu leben und zu arbeiten.

Wir nennen es „AI & Future Skills Retreat“ ✨

Kein Tech-Bootcamp.
Kein Yoga-Retreat.
Es ist etwas Neues.

Wir werden mit Tools experimentieren – aber auch hinterfragen, wie wir mit KI zusammenarbeiten.

Wir werden Übungen machen, die Bewegung, Reflexion und Interaktion mit KI in Echtzeit kombinieren.

Wir werden Prompts entwerfen, Rituale testen und Denkwerkzeuge austauschen 🧠.

Die Veranstaltung ist klein, nur für geladene Gäste – und im Mai tatsächlich bereits fast ausgebucht ✅.

Für Oktober haben wir eine Warteliste und ich würde mich freuen, wenn du mit dabei bist.

Wenn du jemand bist, der spürt, was sich verändert – und es mitgestalten will, statt nur darauf zu reagieren – dann sei mit dabei! 🚀

Schick mir einfach eine Nachricht oder schaue dir direkt unsere kurze Präsentation an.

Robertsch%C3%B6Ne,https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertsch%C3%B6ne,"BIG TECH’S AI BETS - are we back on (AI) track?

""Big tech companies — Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia — earned nearly $2T in aggregate revenue in 2024, up 15% from 2023. 

They already dwarf the private tech sector — surpassing the combined value of all 1,200+ unicorns by a factor of 3 — and after a period of layoffs, they’re back to hiring, with 2024 headcount growing an average of 7% YoY.

Now, they’re betting big on AI to power their next growth phase.""

They are expected to spend over $320 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025. This is a big jump from $246 billion in 2024.

Here are some key points:
➡️ Massive Investments: Amazon plans to spend $100 billion, followed by Microsoft with $80 billion and Google with $75 billion. Most of this money is going into data centers to support AI growth.
➡️ AI and Cloud: AI is driving cloud services forward. Microsoft Azure grew by 31% last year, and Google Cloud is focusing on security to win more business customers.
➡️ Acquisitions Are Back: After a slowdown, big companies are buying again. Alphabet’s $33 billion deal for Wiz shows how important AI-focused acquisitions have become. Nvidia is also leading in funding AI startups.
➡️ New Markets: Companies are exploring areas like humanoid robots and general-purpose AI agents that could change industries.

AI is driving big tech's investments and hiring has ramped up again. 

Have we surpassed the AI trough of disillusionment? What do you think?

Robertsch%C3%B6Ne,https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertsch%C3%B6ne,"Yesterday, I learned I‘m living in another reality.

Caught in an AI bubble. Hunting for the next big leap to transform traditional teams into AI-augmented teams and further push towards agentic AI process automation.

However, I learned valuable lessons by attending the BVMW trade show, “Future of SMEs,” and talking to several businesses, including real estate, construction, hotels, manufacturing, public administration, etc.

Something I learned in AdTech back then as well.

Most people and businesses operate without the drive of curiosity, innovation, and a growth mindset. 

They remain confined within their daily routines. 

Their established practices create a rigid corporate culture. 

There is a strong resistance to change, akin to a corporate immune system that rejects new ideas.

To be at the forefront of innovation is to anticipate the future consistently. 

The journey from the inception of a new trend, feature, or product to widespread adoption is often lengthy and fraught with challenges.

No one I talked to uses a Business AI, even when I described it as a personal ChatGPT for your company files. One company used Co-Pilot, and another one is currently testing ChatGPT. 

The whole market is still at step 1, while I expected it to be at least at step 3 (RAG at scale). 

But I’m living in another reality. 

We all live in our bubble…
