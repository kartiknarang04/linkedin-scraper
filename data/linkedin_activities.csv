It was the simplest content tweak I ever made”

This is what my client texted me yesterday!

How did he do it?

Just started tracking patterns in winning creatives and reposting them with a fresh angle instead of chasing new ideas every time.

That’s it.

The results blew me away:
→ Their engagement rates jumped by 37%
→ A CPG client saw a 42% boost
→ Another client tried it and tripled their shares 🤯🤯

What’s going on here?

We built an AI to answer one question: Who actually drives sales?

Most brands judge influencer performance with likes and vibes.

But engagement ≠ conversions.

And viral ≠ valuable.

So we trained an AI model to dig into what really matters:

💸 Revenue per influencer

🎯 Which creator actually moved product — not just pixels

🧠 Which content type (face-based, storytelling, trend-led) converts best

🚫 And which ones just made noise

Now, you don’t need to guess if that trending collab worked.

You’ll know — with dollar-level attribution, not a comment section.

This is how creator marketing becomes a performance channel.

That’s the biggest lie in performance marketing right now.


We’ve audited 100+ ad accounts this year.
And here’s what we found:




→ Most brands are testing random ideas
→ They wait for ads to die, then chase the next one
→ They burn budget without a system
→ They rely on hope, not data



The brands that win?
They don’t just test more.
They test smarter.




✅ They analyze what’s working
✅ They use AI to spot patterns
✅ They detect fatigue early

Nike’s “Someday is not a day of the week.”

At first glance, it's just a clever one-liner.
But look closer—and you’ll see why it works so well.

🔍 1. It defines a clear enemy.
Nike isn’t competing with other brands here.
They’re calling out:
❌ Procrastination
❌ Excuses
❌ That inner voice saying “later”
“Someday” becomes the symbol of inaction—and they strike it out, visually and conceptually.

🧠 2. It reframes time.
Most people wait for the perfect moment.
This line flips that:
You don’t need “someday”—you need today.

🔥 3. It’s brand-consistent.
This is “Just Do It” reimagined.
Same soul. New packaging.
No product push. No fluff.
Just truth that sticks.

Korean learning spiked 40% after Squid Game Season 1

330M+ global viewers

2.8B hours watched

Netflix saw the distribution opportunity.
Duolingo saw the demand spike in Korean language learning.
And together? They created something weird and wonderful.
🎯 What made it hit:
Duolingo added 40 Squid Game phrases into its Korean course

They dropped cryptic billboards teasing the show

They made original K-pop music with Netflix's sound lab (!)

They feel like the truth your customer already believes.

The faster people scroll.

Why?

Because ad fatigue isn’t just visual.
It’s psychological.

We’ve all developed “ad radar.”
You feel it. Your customers feel it.
It’s the reason 90% of creatives fail.

But here’s what still cuts through:
✅ Realness
✅ Imperfection
✅ Unexpected honesty

You don’t need UGC to feel real.

You need to stop polishing your ads to death.

Let’s create a reference list of agencies to avoid so businesses can make better decisions.

❌ The founder dismissed repeated concerns, telling us to “have faith.”
❌ Work was blindly delegated to junior staff with no real understanding of our business.
❌ Despite multiple training sessions, they kept using messaging we explicitly rejected.
❌ No flexibility, no accountability—just delays and excuses.
❌ When asked for a refund, they ghosted, stretched timelines, and disregarded SLAs.
❌ After barely two weeks of poor work (1 static post + 1 story), they claimed they spent 45 days on our account and offered only 20% back—at some future date, if their accounting team allowed it.

(From the investor’s perspective)

At LvlUp Ventures, we back Seed-stage startups that are bold enough to think differently—and scrappy enough to make it happen.

Here’s what stands out to us when reviewing new opportunities:

✅ Clear Problem & Unique Insight
Startups that truly understand the pain point they're solving and bring a fresh, founder-led perspective to the table.

✅ Early Signs of Traction
This doesn't have to be sky-high revenue—but strong signals like user retention, organic growth, partnerships or early sales channels working well.

✅ A Sharp, Coachable Team
We love founders who are relentless and receptive. You're the expert in your domain—but open to strategic collaboration.

✅ Capital Efficiency
We’re big believers in doing more with less. Efficient execution and thoughtful resource allocation go a long way in this market.

✅ Platform Potential
Can this product evolve into something bigger? We get excited by businesses with real ecosystem or category-defining potential.

Our team rolls up its sleeves post-investment—we don’t just write checks, we help you grow through partnerships, channel support, and deep founder-in-residence experience.

If you're building something bold, we’d love to hear from you.

With all the talk about rising costs, tighter capital, and DTC struggles—it might seem like the odds are stacked against emerging CPG brands. But under the surface, there's something exciting happening:

🔹 Retail buyers are hungry for innovative indie products that build loyalty and drive growth in a saturated aisle.
🔹 Strategic acquirers are back—2024 saw a ~20% YoY increase in M&A activity in food & beverage, especially in better-for-you and premium segments.
🔹 Community-led brands are thriving on platforms like TikTok, where 67% of Gen Z say they discover new CPG products.
🔹 Capital is still flowing, but it’s flowing smarter—investors are favoring capital-efficient operators with strong gross margins and clear paths to profitability.

One of the success factors was turning LinkedIn into a machine.

A machine that converts impressions to clients automatically - without spending money on ads!!!

Now, you, too, can turn LinkedIn into a machine, because I got permission to share it.

This system turns LinkedIn into a nonstop lead generation and revenue engine.

Automated means: Really on autopilot

It is three simple steps only...

This is how the system works:

✅ Automated value-based post
• AI crafts a hyper-specific, “value-bait post” that attracts only your dream clients and confirms demand before you invest hours into creating a resource for them.

✅ Automated content generation
• It transforms your validated post into a high-converting guide that delivers massive value and practically sells itself with every interaction.

✅ Automate follow-ups
• It sets up a powerful automation in n8n so that you follow up on your engaged audience and lead them to a purchasing decision without you ever talking 1-1 with them.

This fully automated system is the secret behind explosive B2B growth, and the best part is that you can set it up for free.

They already dwarf the private tech sector — surpassing the combined value of all 1,200+ unicorns by a factor of 3 — and after a period of layoffs, they’re back to hiring, with 2024 headcount growing an average of 7% YoY.

Now, they’re betting big on AI to power their next growth phase.""

They are expected to spend over $320 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025. This is a big jump from $246 billion in 2024.

Here are some key points:
➡️ Massive Investments: Amazon plans to spend $100 billion, followed by Microsoft with $80 billion and Google with $75 billion. Most of this money is going into data centers to support AI growth.
➡️ AI and Cloud: AI is driving cloud services forward. Microsoft Azure grew by 31% last year, and Google Cloud is focusing on security to win more business customers.
➡️ Acquisitions Are Back: After a slowdown, big companies are buying again. Alphabet’s $33 billion deal for Wiz shows how important AI-focused acquisitions have become. Nvidia is also leading in funding AI startups.
➡️ New Markets: Companies are exploring areas like humanoid robots and general-purpose AI agents that could change industries.

AI is driving big tech's investments and hiring has ramped up again.

Caught in an AI bubble. Hunting for the next big leap to transform traditional teams into AI-augmented teams and further push towards agentic AI process automation.

However, I learned valuable lessons by attending the BVMW trade show, “Future of SMEs,” and talking to several businesses, including real estate, construction, hotels, manufacturing, public administration, etc.

Something I learned in AdTech back then as well.

Most people and businesses operate without the drive of curiosity, innovation, and a growth mindset.

They remain confined within their daily routines.

Their established practices create a rigid corporate culture.

There is a strong resistance to change, akin to a corporate immune system that rejects new ideas.

To be at the forefront of innovation is to anticipate the future consistently.

The journey from the inception of a new trend, feature, or product to widespread adoption is often lengthy and fraught with challenges.

No one I talked to uses a Business AI, even when I described it as a personal ChatGPT for your company files. One company used Co-Pilot, and another one is currently testing ChatGPT.

The whole market is still at step 1, while I expected it to be at least at step 3 (RAG at scale).

But I’m living in another reality.

We all live in our bubble…

That's what my mentor told us during our weekly community call last week.

Before he showed us the process.

A process on how he generates lead magnets and posts that go viral.

All in less than 10 minutes.

During the call, he shared a tool that also drafts it for us.

And now you, too, can get it.

Why does it matter? Last week, I had +70.000 Impressions, which helped me gain visibility as a person on LinkedIn and share my thoughts about how AI can be used to drive business transformation and increase employee satisfaction.

Yes, it is value-driven content, branding-building, and automation - to cut through the noise and craft your positioning.

Such tools are helpful in a) saving valuable time and b) sparking discussion among people interested in the matter.

Use the tool to:
✅ Build a detailed profile of your ideal customer.
✅ Develop a lead magnet designed to solve their specific pain points.
✅ Craft LinkedIn posts that promote the lead magnet and drive engagement.

This system helped many of my community fellows, and myself achieve thousands of views and leads.

That's what my mentor told me when I started learning the system 4 months ago.

Since then, they've generated 15.000 leads at no cost, and I know it works.

How?

Because it worked for me as well.

Getting 150 leads (and still growing) from 1 single post (which was about ""Agentic AI in Digital Agencies"")

Now you can, too, because I got permission to share the system.

To all, I recommend the B2B Protocol because it helps with...
✅ Generating quality leads and conversations directly with decision-makers (skipping the gatekeepers)
✅ Growing your network and building relationships with your audience for sustainable growth long-term
✅ Increasing the efficiency of each salesperson and ensuring higher profitability

You will have rock-solid conviction, and leads will come your way.

This protocol has been responsible for:
Starting more than 1900 conversations for a SaaS firm (which got acquired).
Booked 150+ guests for a podcast in less than 60 days.
Achieved 650.000 impressions on LinkedIn in 4 weeks.

Activity | Robert Schöne,https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertsch%C3%B6ne/,Post,"No progress without (good) debates. 

We need to debate, including the one about AI. And we need to have different opinions.

On the one hand, there are those who see the potential, the positive benefits and the world-changing effects.

On the other side are those who are worried and have fears and concerns.

There are always two sides to the same coin. It's what is called the principle of polarity.

Black and white, yes and no, agree and disagree.

I belong to the group of visionaries, positive thinkers, curious, and sometimes also naive.

But I am less on the technical side and more on the humanistic side of AI. Does that sound counterintuitive?

Let me explain! To me, AI, if used correctly, will bring two things to lift human potential:

𝟏. 𝐖𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐛𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐢𝐧 𝐟𝐥𝐨𝐰
The challenge-skills balance is a key trigger for experiencing flow. It describes the state in which the demands of a task slightly exceed a person's abilities. If the challenge is too great, anxiety can arise, while boredom sets in if the challenge is too low. Flow occurs in an area known as the ‘flow channel’ and lies between these two extremes. This means that through working and living alongside AI, we will experience more flow. Repetitive and mundane tasks can be handed over, and complicated tasks and complex questions can be solved more easily.

𝟐. 𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐀𝐈 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐮𝐬 𝐛𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐤𝐞𝐫𝐬
Now that we have an omnipotent assistant whom we can ask, we must rethink our thinking. We need to become more curious again. It's not about advising AI; it is about asking the right questions and thinking in the correct pattern. We need to ask ourselves:
‘What instructions could I give or what question could I ask so that the AI understands and gets me from A to B, solve a problem, or execute a task?’
This thinking will be more systemic, problem- and solution-orientated.

I'm still so excited about what the future will hold for us.

Steven Kotler recently wrote: Humans, in flow, who can collaborate with each other, and with AI, are going to own the future.

Agree?

Activity | Jaspar Carmichael-Jack,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaspar-carmichael-jack/,Post,"About a weeks ago, we put up a billboard to announce our $25M Series A on the 101 with one goal: Make it so cringe it gets memed on the internet

Why?

Because today, there are so many AI startups raising money, announcing something, launching something that they all blur together

And it's becoming increasingly the case that having the best product isn’t enough if you can't cut through the noise

So…we went for it - we made the most cringe billboard I’ve ever seen (thank you)

And now there are multiple Tweets and Reddit threads going semi-viral, with most people not realizing it’s a joke

We’ve accidentally-on-purpose used this rage bait tactic multiple times now:
- Got flamed on Reddit for hating on our own TechCrunch booth
- Launched our entire ""Stop Hiring Humans"" campaign
- Faked my resignation as CEO and hired an AI CEO on April Fools

So yes, this billboard is cringe, but it’s already got over 1M impressions and has led to loads of high quality leads googling us to learn about our AI BDR and coming inbound

If your marketing doesn’t make people feel something (be it excitement, confusion, anger, cringe, or any other emotion), it won’t have an impact

We saw this with the “Cheat on Everything” video - it’s rage bait and is generating $millions in ARR for Cluely

𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗯𝘆 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗶𝘀
- Before any outreach, I asked myself: Where do I want to be in 5–7 years?
- My answer: Product x Vertical AI Agents. Even this broad vision helped me filter my search
- The path may not always be linear, and that’s okay. But try to build towards where you want to be

𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽𝘀 𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴
.. and apply filters that align with where you want to work
- Sector fit → I focused on AI agents
- Recent funding rounds (announced <6 months ago) → signals momentum and recruiting appetite
- Round size (>$8M) → I leaned toward Seed and Series A startups that raised enough to offer a real runway and stability

𝗦𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗟𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗲𝗱𝗜𝗻 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗲𝗹𝗹 𝗬𝗢𝗨
- Everyone says “demonstrate where you can add value.” I found that… unproductive
- Startups are chaotic! You’ll never guess what’s top of mind for them
- So I focused on what I did know: my track record and my skills

𝗔𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗲𝗺𝗽𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗼𝗻 𝘂𝗻𝗽𝗮𝗶𝗱 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽𝘀
- I have 5+ years of experience, and I value my time
- But more than that, if your time has no defined value, you risk being handed low leverage / low value work

Activity | Jaspar Carmichael-Jack,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaspar-carmichael-jack/,Post,"We raised our $25M Series A just 6 months after our seed. Here are the four reasons why:

1. The market is moving fast. A lot of new players are entering and we need to ship amazing products fast if we want to win

2. We want to maintain our really strong momentum. A lot of startups lose their momentum and their velocity platesus if they sit in one funding stage for too long. Raising keeps the team excited, opens doors with bigger customers and builds brand awareness

3. We wanted to attract amazing talent (most senior leadership & great engineers don’t want to take a risk on a seed stage company)

4. We know what we need to build, it’s just a matter of executing. And to build our ambitious roadmap, we needed more talented people on the team

Every startup has its own pace. For Artisan, it’s moving relentlessly fast because we know we have an opportunity here and we don’t want to miss it

For some, building a company bootstrapped is the right path. If you want to maintain full control of your company, choose your own pace and take dividends, don’t raise money. If you want to move extremely fast and build a generational company, raise at a regular cadence

Here’s what’s new in V3:

Data miner - Ava scrapes 100s of sources (firmographic, technographic, intent) to pull rich lead data

Personalization waterfall - Ava dynamically identifies the best personalization on a lead level

Watchtower campaigns - Ava monitors intent signals across the internet and launches outreach the moment a lead shows buying intent (this is being rolled out with more and more triggers over the next few months)

Designed to stand out in a sea of tech jargon, the intentionally provocative message positioned Artisan’s AI SDR, Ava, as the future of sales development. What started with a single misspelled billboard (“Stop Hirring Humans”) quickly snowballed into viral outrage, 35,000upvotes, media frenzy, and even death threats.

Despite the backlash, Artisan doubled down on the controversy, with CEOposting the campaign on r/mildlyinfuriating, sparking millions of impressions. “We wanted to draw eyes and spark interest... while driving a bit of rage with the wider public,” Jaspar admitted. Their strategy worked — Artisan was soon flooded with sales meetings, made headlines in top media houses and saw over $2M in new ARR.

Beyond the noise, the campaign paid off — Artisan is now one of the fastest-growing AI companies by brand search, per Ahrefs. “70% of the people I meet in San Francisco now know Artisan. Before it was 5%,” says Jaspar. Though the messaging stirred controversy, it struck gold with their actual audience: tech companies looking to automate grunt work, not replace humans entirely.
In the end, Artisan clarified: “The truth is, we love humans.” The mission isn’t dystopia — it’s about freeing humans from tedious tasks. Ava was built to take care of what people don’t want to do, not take their place. Bold, risky, and a little chaotic — Artisan’s campaign is a masterclass in standing out in tech’s loudest city.","2w •

It wasn’t smooth sailing to begin with, I was turned down by over 100 investors when I first started raising (to be fair, we didn’t have a product...)

Thentook a bet on us and gave us our first check for $1.75M

We got intoshortly after that, and it’s been an insane journey since then

In the past 12 months, we’ve:
- Built Ava, the AI BDR - our flagship Artisan
- Closed hundreds of customers
- Reached $5M ARR
- Gone viral with 1B+ online impressions on our “Stop Hiring Humans” shock marketing campaign
- Hired an incredible team, including our new CTO

I'm extremely proud of the team we've built atand the extraordinarily talented people I get to work with every day

It's been an insane journey that all started withtaking a bet on us in September 2023 when we had no product and were weeks away from running out of money

A week later, we got into

This week Ava's face was up in Times Square

We've already built the strongest AI BDR product on the market and reached billions of impressions with our marketing, but we have so much more to come this year - stay tuned","2w •

Except, it was an April Fool’s prank.

You’ve probably seen the videoposted where he announces he’s stepping down and being replaced by our AI CEO, Jaspar 2.0

(If not, definitely check it out here:)

While many people thought the whole thing was AI generated, it was in fact 100% human made

We hired an entire film crew, rented a mansion and casted our AI CEO,(who is a really human, even if he does look totally AI-generated)

We were up against a lot of constraints:

Timeline = under 3 weeks
Budget = less than $20k
Experience = none, apart from one film class I took in 11th grade

(For reference, when we enquired creative agencies, one said it would be $100k+ and they needed at least 3 months to execute it)

We had zero film experience and an impossibly tight turnaround time...

But we ended up delivering a pretty amazing (if I do say so myself) campaign that drove 100,000+ impressions for Artisan

Jaspar even got a few real job offers!

If you're curious how we pulled it off, I wrote a blog breaking down everything here:

Proof that anything’s possible when you decide it is.

Convenience & Ease. 👇

While I'll always say you should use& you shoul create your own tech stack to suit your own needs...

There is no denying that these all-in-one solutions are getting better everyday.

Here's some examples:

a)

They're making the most of AI Agents, and will also source all types of first & 3rd party signals for you.

b)

Common Room replaces the need for Clay by sourcing intent data & performing deep prospect research you can use for your outbound campaigns.

c)

While not as powerful with finding signals, lemlist allows you to link yourkey, allowing you to create AI Variables.

With their chrome extension you're also able to get some awesome data to feed to GPT.

d)

Withwill set-up your email infrastructure, meaning you can use their tool to identify you website vistors & outreach all in one place. (Plus they even have a CRM.)

e)

Now the most unique example is Artisan, where they'll do everything from beginning to end. From hunting for signals, sourcing prospects, crafting campaigns, and outreaching.

... Let's pause for a second, because while I'd still say you can use Clay and just a couple other tools to also achieve the same thing.

You can't deny the convenience of all-in-one platforms, and with the rate they're advancing at...

It's not completely out of the realm to say they might overtake tools such as Clay, through ease of use alone.

While I still think we're quite far from that point, I also don't think we're too far from this being reality. 👀

What's your thoughts on AI SDR's and All-In-One platforms?

P.S. We're running a Webinar with Unify @ 5 PM CET today, if you have any thoughts about all-in-one platforms, feel free to join us live on Linkedin to discuss them with their CEOdirectly. 😉","3w •

I'm so proud of what we’ve built and the incredible team we’ve created. This was a really difficult decision, but one that is ultimately is best for Artisan

The new CEO is the most capable person I know, and I have no doubt he’ll successfully lead Artisan on our goal of becoming a multi-billion dollar company

I’m proud to introduce him in the video below

Grateful for everything we’ve built — and excited to see where the team goes from here. Onward 🚀","3w •
