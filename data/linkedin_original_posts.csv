Robertsch%C3%B6Ne,https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertsch%C3%B6ne,"👉 Back to Real Life!
Nachdem wir in den letzten Tagen gesehen haben, was die KI schon alles kann 🤖, ist es mal wieder Zeit, zurück ins echte Leben zu gehen.

Da sind die wenigsten von uns Action-Helden, sondern ganz normale analoge Menschen. Und das ist auch gut so! 🙌

Gleichzeitig können wir beide Welten kombinieren: KI und MI, Digitalisierung und Detox, Automatisierung und Achtsamkeit.

Genau das planen Steffi Kieffer und ich Ende Mai und im Oktober 📅.
Wir wollen mit Gleichgesinnten entdecken, was es bedeutet, mit KI zu leben und zu arbeiten.

Wir nennen es „AI & Future Skills Retreat“ ✨

Kein Tech-Bootcamp.
Kein Yoga-Retreat.
Es ist etwas Neues.

Wir werden mit Tools experimentieren – aber auch hinterfragen, wie wir mit KI zusammenarbeiten.

Wir werden Übungen machen, die Bewegung, Reflexion und Interaktion mit KI in Echtzeit kombinieren.

Wir werden Prompts entwerfen, Rituale testen und Denkwerkzeuge austauschen 🧠.

Die Veranstaltung ist klein, nur für geladene Gäste – und im Mai tatsächlich bereits fast ausgebucht ✅.

Für Oktober haben wir eine Warteliste und ich würde mich freuen, wenn du mit dabei bist.

Wenn du jemand bist, der spürt, was sich verändert – und es mitgestalten will, statt nur darauf zu reagieren – dann sei mit dabei! 🚀

Schick mir einfach eine Nachricht oder schaue dir direkt unsere kurze Präsentation an.

Robertsch%C3%B6Ne,https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertsch%C3%B6ne,"BIG TECH’S AI BETS - are we back on (AI) track?

""Big tech companies — Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia — earned nearly $2T in aggregate revenue in 2024, up 15% from 2023. 

They already dwarf the private tech sector — surpassing the combined value of all 1,200+ unicorns by a factor of 3 — and after a period of layoffs, they’re back to hiring, with 2024 headcount growing an average of 7% YoY.

Now, they’re betting big on AI to power their next growth phase.""

They are expected to spend over $320 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025. This is a big jump from $246 billion in 2024.

Here are some key points:
➡️ Massive Investments: Amazon plans to spend $100 billion, followed by Microsoft with $80 billion and Google with $75 billion. Most of this money is going into data centers to support AI growth.
➡️ AI and Cloud: AI is driving cloud services forward. Microsoft Azure grew by 31% last year, and Google Cloud is focusing on security to win more business customers.
➡️ Acquisitions Are Back: After a slowdown, big companies are buying again. Alphabet’s $33 billion deal for Wiz shows how important AI-focused acquisitions have become. Nvidia is also leading in funding AI startups.
➡️ New Markets: Companies are exploring areas like humanoid robots and general-purpose AI agents that could change industries.

AI is driving big tech's investments and hiring has ramped up again. 

Have we surpassed the AI trough of disillusionment? What do you think?

It is a detailed process that covers content generation, pipeline building, and upselling.

Robertsch%C3%B6Ne,https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertsch%C3%B6ne,"Yesterday, I learned I‘m living in another reality.

Caught in an AI bubble. Hunting for the next big leap to transform traditional teams into AI-augmented teams and further push towards agentic AI process automation.

However, I learned valuable lessons by attending the BVMW trade show, “Future of SMEs,” and talking to several businesses, including real estate, construction, hotels, manufacturing, public administration, etc.

Something I learned in AdTech back then as well.

Most people and businesses operate without the drive of curiosity, innovation, and a growth mindset. 

They remain confined within their daily routines. 

Their established practices create a rigid corporate culture. 

There is a strong resistance to change, akin to a corporate immune system that rejects new ideas.

To be at the forefront of innovation is to anticipate the future consistently. 

The journey from the inception of a new trend, feature, or product to widespread adoption is often lengthy and fraught with challenges.

No one I talked to uses a Business AI, even when I described it as a personal ChatGPT for your company files. One company used Co-Pilot, and another one is currently testing ChatGPT. 

The whole market is still at step 1, while I expected it to be at least at step 3 (RAG at scale). 

But I’m living in another reality. 

We all live in our bubble…

Archit Anand,https://www.linkedin.com/in/archit-anand,"“More testing = more scale.”

That’s the biggest lie in performance marketing right now.

We’ve audited 100+ ad accounts this year.
And here’s what we found:

→ Most brands are testing random ideas
 → They wait for ads to die, then chase the next one
 → They burn budget without a system
 → They rely on hope, not data

The brands that win?
They don’t just test more.
They test smarter.

✅ They analyze what’s working
✅ They use AI to spot patterns
✅ They detect fatigue early
✅ And they scale with confidence

Archit Anand,https://www.linkedin.com/in/archit-anand,"“Will AI replace creatives?”

Not until clients can accurately describe what they want 😅

So yes — creatives, you’re safe.
(And to be clear: we’re not trying to replace you either.)

Because creative isn’t just a nice-to-have — it’s the #1 performance lever for brands.

At Fuelgrowth, we’ve seen this over and over again:
 → Brands don’t fail because of bad media buying
 → They fail because they never found the right creative system

So this week, I’m sharing what we’ve learned from auditing 100+ ad accounts —
 The real reasons ROAS drops
 The hidden fatigue patterns

And how we use AI to spot winning concepts before they scale

If you run ads, lead performance, or are just tired of guesswork —

This one’s for you.

Archit Anand,https://www.linkedin.com/in/archit-anand,"Ad I loved recently:

Nike’s “Someday is not a day of the week.”

At first glance, it's just a clever one-liner.
But look closer—and you’ll see why it works so well.

🔍 1. It defines a clear enemy.
Nike isn’t competing with other brands here.
They’re calling out:
❌ Procrastination
❌ Excuses
❌ That inner voice saying “later”
“Someday” becomes the symbol of inaction—and they strike it out, visually and conceptually.

🧠 2. It reframes time.
Most people wait for the perfect moment.
This line flips that:
You don’t need “someday”—you need today.

🔥 3. It’s brand-consistent.
This is “Just Do It” reimagined.
Same soul. New packaging.
No product push. No fluff.
Just truth that sticks.

That’s how you create an ad that shifts mindset—not just sales.
