Archit Anand,https://www.linkedin.com/in/archit-anand,"“More testing = more scale.”

That’s the biggest lie in performance marketing right now.

We’ve audited 100+ ad accounts this year.
And here’s what we found:

→ Most brands are testing random ideas
 → They wait for ads to die, then chase the next one
 → They burn budget without a system
 → They rely on hope, not data

The brands that win?
They don’t just test more.
They test smarter.

✅ They analyze what’s working
✅ They use AI to spot patterns
✅ They detect fatigue early
✅ And they scale with confidence

Archit Anand,https://www.linkedin.com/in/archit-anand,"“Will AI replace creatives?”

Not until clients can accurately describe what they want 😅

So yes — creatives, you’re safe.
(And to be clear: we’re not trying to replace you either.)

Because creative isn’t just a nice-to-have — it’s the #1 performance lever for brands.

At Fuelgrowth, we’ve seen this over and over again:
 → Brands don’t fail because of bad media buying
 → They fail because they never found the right creative system

So this week, I’m sharing what we’ve learned from auditing 100+ ad accounts —
 The real reasons ROAS drops
 The hidden fatigue patterns

And how we use AI to spot winning concepts before they scale

If you run ads, lead performance, or are just tired of guesswork —

This one’s for you.

Stay tuned and follow for more✌️

Archit Anand,https://www.linkedin.com/in/archit-anand,"Ad I loved recently:

Nike’s “Someday is not a day of the week.”

At first glance, it's just a clever one-liner.
But look closer—and you’ll see why it works so well.

🔍 1. It defines a clear enemy.
Nike isn’t competing with other brands here.
They’re calling out:
❌ Procrastination
❌ Excuses
❌ That inner voice saying “later”
“Someday” becomes the symbol of inaction—and they strike it out, visually and conceptually.

🧠 2. It reframes time.
Most people wait for the perfect moment.
This line flips that:
You don’t need “someday”—you need today.

🔥 3. It’s brand-consistent.
This is “Just Do It” reimagined.
Same soul. New packaging.
No product push. No fluff.
Just truth that sticks.

That’s how you create an ad that shifts mindset—not just sales.
