Jaspar Carmichael Jack,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaspar-carmichael-jack,"About a weeks ago, we put up a billboard to announce our $25M Series A on the 101 with one goal: Make it so cringe it gets memed on the internet

Why?

Because today, there are so many AI startups raising money, announcing something, launching something that they all blur together

And it's becoming increasingly the case that having the best product isn’t enough if you can't cut through the noise

So…we went for it - we made the most cringe billboard I’ve ever seen (thank you Tina Sang)

And now there are multiple Tweets and Reddit threads going semi-viral, with most people not realizing it’s a joke 

We’ve accidentally-on-purpose used this rage bait tactic multiple times now:
- Got flamed on Reddit for hating on our own TechCrunch booth
- Launched our entire ""Stop Hiring Humans"" campaign
- Faked my resignation as CEO and hired an AI CEO on April Fools

So yes, this billboard is cringe, but it’s already got over 1M impressions and has led to loads of high quality leads googling us to learn about our AI BDR and coming inbound 

If your marketing doesn’t make people feel something (be it excitement, confusion, anger, cringe, or any other emotion), it won’t have an impact 

We saw this with the “Cheat on Everything” video - it’s rage bait and is generating $millions in ARR for Cluely

If you want to automate your outbound and avoid cold emails that feel just as cringe, hire Ava, the AI BDR: https://lnkd.in/erKwdu4i

Jaspar Carmichael Jack,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaspar-carmichael-jack,"We’ve raised over $35M, crossed $5M ARR, generated billions of organic impressions - and still have zero people on our internal marketing team

That’s not because marketing isn’t a priority. If you’ve seen our billboards or AI CEO, you know we take brand awareness very seriously...

We’ve just been deliberate about staying lean. While we’ve hired aggressively across product and engineering, marketing is the one function we’ve chosen to scale differently - all campaigns are managed by me and Tina Sang

Our marketing approach is to:
- Stick to activities which leverage our time as much as possible
- Leverage AI and automation as much as possible
- Avoid wasting time on bureaucracy
- Ruthlessly prioritize with quarterly marketing strategies
- Rely on expert freelancers for specific functions like SEO, paid, content, video, animation & much more. We couldn’t achieve what we have without them

A bloated internal marketing team drains creativity and slows you down

That being said, we're at capacity and we’re ready to finally make our first marketing hire! If you want to help us brainstorm crazy billboard slogans or our next viral campaign, apply here: artisan.co/careers

Jaspar Carmichael Jack,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaspar-carmichael-jack,"We raised our $25M Series A just 6 months after our seed. Here are the four reasons why:

1. The market is moving fast. A lot of new players are entering and we need to ship amazing products fast if we want to win

2. We want to maintain our really strong momentum. A lot of startups lose their momentum and their velocity platesus if they sit in one funding stage for too long. Raising keeps the team excited, opens doors with bigger customers and builds brand awareness

3. We wanted to attract amazing talent (most senior leadership & great engineers don’t want to take a risk on a seed stage company)

4. We know what we need to build, it’s just a matter of executing. And to build our ambitious roadmap, we needed more talented people on the team

Every startup has its own pace. For Artisan, it’s moving relentlessly fast because we know we have an opportunity here and we don’t want to miss it 

For some, building a company bootstrapped is the right path. If you want to maintain full control of your company, choose your own pace and take dividends, don’t raise money. If you want to move extremely fast and build a generational company, raise at a regular cadence
