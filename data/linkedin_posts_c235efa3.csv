Archit Anand,https://www.linkedin.com/in/archit-anand,"Your most viral influencer? Probably made you $0

We built an AI to answer one question: Who actually drives sales?

Most brands judge influencer performance with likes and vibes.

But engagement ≠ conversions.

And viral ≠ valuable.

So we trained an AI model to dig into what really matters:

💸 Revenue per influencer

🎯 Which creator actually moved product — not just pixels

🧠 Which content type (face-based, storytelling, trend-led) converts best

🚫 And which ones just made noise

Now, you don’t need to guess if that trending collab worked.

You’ll know — with dollar-level attribution, not a comment section.

This is how creator marketing becomes a performance channel.

Want a look at how it works?

Archit Anand,https://www.linkedin.com/in/archit-anand,"Is Your Meta Ads Budget Going to Waste?

We’ve audited 100+ ad accounts from fast-growing DTC brands.

And the same problems keep showing up:
• Creative fatigue that no one notices
• Bidding strategies that stall past $10K/month
• Targeting that worked last quarter but tanks now

Most brands don’t have a system to catch these.

We built one.
In this post, I break down:
• How we reset targeting without losing momentum
• The creative refresh loop that sustains ROAS
• A 7-step checklist we use with every brand we work with

Archit Anand,https://www.linkedin.com/in/archit-anand,"12 brutal reasons to NEVER make friends at work:

1/ You might get too much help with challenges 
⚠️ Could ask for advice without fear of judgment

2/ You could make real, lifelong friends 
⚠️ You might start caring about your coworkers 😳

3/ Danger of creating an enviously positive culture 
⚠️ People might actually like Mondays

4/ Might get invited to too many after-work events 
⚠️ You’ll be forced to have fun on weeknights

5/ You could learn new skills by accident 
⚠️ Just by being around smart people

6/ Risk of honest feedback from people who care 
⚠️ Growth could become inevitable

7/ You might enjoy meetings 
⚠️ Yes… even team meetings

8/ Risk of expanding your comfort zone without realising 
⚠️ And actually grow (scary right !?)

9/ You might become a better communicator 
⚠️ People may start calling you a leader

10/ New ideas might show up unexpectedly 
⚠️ Creative ideas flow better among friends

11/ Job satisfaction might reach record highs 
⚠️ Risk of becoming the most engaged employee

12/ Access to informal knowledge across departments 
⚠️ You might start to know too much!

I get it...

Keeping work ""strictly professional"" feels safer.

No drama. 
No getting hurt. 
No tricky stuff with projects and promotions.

But research shows friendship at work is a serious performance booster.

Because people need people.

And when you like who you work with, work gets easier.

Agreed?

Archit Anand,https://www.linkedin.com/in/archit-anand,"My favorite brand collab of 2025 so far: Duolingo × Squid Game.
It’s one of those rare campaigns that nails both sides of the equation:
Creative + Strategy.
Let’s break down why it worked 👇
📊 It was built on data:
Korean learning spiked 40% after Squid Game Season 1

330M+ global viewers

2.8B hours watched

Netflix saw the distribution opportunity.
 Duolingo saw the demand spike in Korean language learning.
 And together? They created something weird and wonderful.
🎯 What made it hit:
Duolingo added 40 Squid Game phrases into its Korean course

They dropped cryptic billboards teasing the show

They made original K-pop music with Netflix's sound lab (!)

It’s a perfect example of creative strategy done right:
Find the cultural wave.
Use data to validate the bet.
Then go all-in with personality.
Honestly? 10/10.
No notes.
